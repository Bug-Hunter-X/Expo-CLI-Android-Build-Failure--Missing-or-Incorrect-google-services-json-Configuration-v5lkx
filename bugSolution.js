The solution involves ensuring the `google-services.json` file (obtained from your Firebase project) is correctly placed in the `android/app` directory.  No code changes are required in the main app files.  The problem lies solely in the project setup.

```javascript
// bug.js (This file is empty; the bug is in the project structure)

```

```javascript
// bugSolution.js (Illustrative of the project setup solution)
// Ensure that google-services.json exists in the android/app folder.
// If it's missing, download it from your Firebase project settings and place it there.

// Example structure:
// expo-app/
// ├── android/
// │   └── app/
// │       └── google-services.json
// └── ...
```
