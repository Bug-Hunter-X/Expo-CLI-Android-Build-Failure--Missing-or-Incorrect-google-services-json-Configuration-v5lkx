This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  The error message is cryptic, often mentioning issues with signing configurations or keystores, but the underlying cause is actually an incorrect or missing `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory.  This file is essential for Firebase integration and other Google services.  The Expo CLI doesn't always provide clear instructions on how to ensure this file is correctly placed and configured, leading to confusion and wasted time.  The exact error message may vary depending on the specific Google service used, but it commonly results in a failed build process.
